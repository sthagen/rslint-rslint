# Dev Docs

You may be asking, _how does all of this even work?_, well you are in the right place to find out!
These docs will outline the inner workings of RSLint all the way from the high level architecture and concepts to the individual
crates powering the linter.

::: warning

These docs assume you are comfortable with Rust as the project is written in rust. You can follow along even if you aren't, but you
may not understand some of the more in depth areas, here are some resources to learn Rust (a great language!):

- [the book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/)
- [rust by example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/)

## Contributing

The best way to learn is to contribute! You can find issues to work on by looking at [issues](https://github.com/rslint/rslint/issues) with the `E-Easy` and `E-Mentor` labels. `E-Mentor` issues have explanations as to how to fix/implement the topic of the issue to guide you through.
